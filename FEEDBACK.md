#### Feedback:  

Cole, amazing project. Youâ€™re a complete work horse, and definitely proficient at development. Your app was ripe with more functionality than I imagined, and furthermore I love how you brought in a peer reviewed source as the inspiration. Deeply rooted facts and arguments always help make great applications.

Your presentation was outstanding as well, and its great that you already had a v2 in the works, and had the ability to discuss what you would do differently.  I thought the UI was great. Just wait until react! I will show you some novel ways to make the app render well on mobile (which it already does, might I add).

Please flush out the readme, and be sure to include your link to the deployed app so you future employers can easily access the site. Otherwise great job.
